# SocialNetworkApi

## Description

  This Back end application is supposed to reflect what a social network backend might look like. Using RESTfull technolgies I think this back end is extremely versitile and allows users/ testing to refelct how easy making the front end for this application should be. all of the database managment, models, and routes reflect synchronisity, and you can thank mongoose for making that so easy and breezy. This application features "dynamic" express routes, and features mongoose, which really just cleans up the process of using mongodb and makes it super super easy.

## Why?

  Becoming a developer is TOUGH, and this was a really difficult challenge for me, it really streched my knowledge and creativity, making everything work together seamlesly and synchornously was that hardest part, there are lots of moving parts, and lots of different code bits to keep track of to make sure everything syncs up in the end when we hit the route. I believe this challenge helped me grow exponentialy as a developer!

## Usage

  Heres a tutorial on how to setup this code and get it working. The getting it set up part is really only the first minute of the video, the rest of the video is showing the database management, and hitting all the aspects of the application with insomnia. If you dont want to go read all the routes and models I would highly suggest you watch the tutorial it makes all of it way easier to understand!

  1. This is open usage with NO Liscence, anyone can use this code however whenever they want and for any purpose.
  2. clone or download repository as zip and open it in your favorite console/IDE given either of those are compatable with node, and you have node installed.
  3. run {npm i} to install all dependencies.
  4. run {npm run seed} to seed your mongodb database with a couple users, thoughts, and reactions.
  5. run{npm start} to start the application, now youll be able to actually hit the routes in real time, IT IS HIGHLY SUGGESTED to use some kind of route hitter/test like insomnia or postman.
